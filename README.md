### A bit about me

I am Ivan, Chung Yuen Leung from Hong Kong. Now based in UK. My passion for data analysis and technology was sparked during my internship experience at ByteDance, where I was inspired to pursue a career in data analytics. I subsequently pursued an internship with the Government of Hong Kong, where I worked with GIS analysis, further developing my skills and expertise in this field.

In addition, I have completed a data analytics boot camp with Generation UK, which has enabled me to enhance my technical skills even further. I have graduated with a strong technical degree in Information Engineering, which has provided me with a solid foundation in data analytics and technology.

I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and experience in data analytics and technology, and I am eager to collaborate with others in the field to achieve new heights of success. I am confident that my experience and skill set would be valuable assets to any team or project.
